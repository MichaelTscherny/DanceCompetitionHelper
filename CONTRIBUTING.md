# Contributing

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) 
to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE.md).

Everyone is welcome to contribute to **Dance Competition Helper**. 
Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests—there are many 
different ways for you to get involved, including answering questions, 
reporting or triaging [issues](https://github.com/MichaelTscherny/DanceCompetitionHelper/issues).

No matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn 
what's expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading 
the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Please note:

- Take a look at the [branch's project](https://github.com/users/MichaelTscherny/projects/1)
  to see if there is already an issue for what wou like to have
    - one branch for 1..n issues - use the first issue as name and link others
    - please don't do "too much" in one issue
    - "main" branch is blocked for all pushes - must be a pull-request!
- write unit-tests for your code - *no unit tests* for new code, *no "accept"*
- if you like dev-branches created from featrue-branches, please do so. Also PRs
  to feature-branches needs to be approved

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request **is accepted**:

- Make sure the tests pass
- Update the documentation: code comments, example code, guides. Basically,
  update everything affected by your contribution.
- Include any information that would be relevant to reproducing bugs, 
  use cases for new features, etc.
- Your commits are associated with your GitHub user: https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/
- Make pull requests against a feature branch,

## Service Level Agreement

There is no. If there is time, I will work on the project.
